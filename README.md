# SharePoint-Staffing-Changes
I built a custom form using bootstrap, CSS and JavaScript to make a custom user interface for storing and updating staffing changes. 

Project Summary:

The goal of this project is to automate the processing of staffing changes such as internal transfers, attrition and shift-changes.  I created a form which interacts with the employee list.  This form is built using HTML (Bootstrap) and automated using JavaScript.  The form creates a staffing change entry.  This staffing change triggers a workflow which handles sending out confirmation e-mails and updating the master record.   The workflow was designed with SharePoint Designer.
